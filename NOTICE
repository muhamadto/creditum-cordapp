Copyright 2016 Mohamed Hamtou

This product includes software developed at R3 (https://www.r3.com/).

The entirety of the java source code and tests were developed by R3 as a corda training example (https://github.com/corda/corda-training-solutions)
docker-compose file was initially created by R3 corda (https://gist.github.com/ashutoshmeher-r3/e6bfd7c76d11b20ef4a8641823168842#file-docker-compose-corda-yaml)

Mohamed Hamtou has included some modifications including:
* Using lombok to create boilerplate code (e.g. equals, toString, constructors, ... etc)
* Added a constructor for deserialization in `com.coffeebeans.creditum.state.IOUState`
* Restricting access modifier for fields.
* Replace direct access to instance variables with getter access
* Upgrading docker-compose version to 3.7 and using absolute paths to mount directories instead or relative paths
* Changed test names to be appended with `Test` instead of `Tests` (e.g. `IOUStateTest` instead of `IOUStateTests`)
* Opted to not use flow tests as the network setup is heaveily dependednt on gradle
